Summary:	Default output stream.
Returns:	The default output stream.

Description:
The default output stream for output from the program.

In command-line programs, this is usually used to output the results
of running the program.  In CGI programs running on servers, this is
usually used to output the data to be sent to the client.

Summary:	Default error stream.
Returns:	The default error stream.

Description:
The default error stream for diagnostic information.

In command-line programs, this is usually used to display error
messages.  In server programs, data output through this stream may be
stored in the system log, depending on the server configuration.

Summary:	Write data to a stream.

Buffer:	An expression that evaluates to binary data.
Stream:	An expression that evaluates to a stream.

Description:
Write some data to a stream.  If not all of the data can be written,
fails with an error.

>some streams will write that part of the data and discard the rest.
>This may cause loss of data.
